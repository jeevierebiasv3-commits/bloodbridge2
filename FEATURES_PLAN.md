# Features Plan — Push Notifications, Compatibility, Eligibility, Map View

Four high-impact features, ordered so each phase ships on its own: compatibility polish → eligibility gating → map view → push notifications (biggest, needs EAS setup).

**Context:** Two of the four "features" already half-exist. Blood-type compatibility is live in the feed (`canDonateTo` filter "Can help", `src/app/(tabs)/feed.tsx:41`) and on request cards ("You can help" badge). The eligibility countdown is live on Home's hero (`computeEligibility`, `src/app/(tabs)/home.tsx:163-236`), the Donor tab, and the donor card. So Phases A–B are *closing the gaps* in those, while the map (Phase C) and push (Phase D) are greenfield: no coordinates are ever serialized to the client today, and there is zero push infrastructure (no lib, no token storage, no send path).

## SDK 57 docs verification (drives library choices)

Checked against https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/:

| Fact | Consequence |
|---|---|
| `expo-notifications` remote push: **works in Expo Go on iOS**, **requires a development build on Android** (since SDK 53); no web support | Plan an honest demo path: full flow on iOS Expo Go; Android needs `eas build --profile development`. Opt-in card hidden on web. |
| `getExpoPushTokenAsync` **requires a `projectId`** (`extra.eas.projectId`) | One-time `eas init` (needs `eas login`) before Phase D client work. |
| Android 13+: a notification **channel must exist before requesting the token**; channel setup also triggers the OS opt-in prompt | Call `setNotificationChannelAsync` before `getExpoPushTokenAsync` on Android. |
| `expo-maps` is **alpha, dev-build only** | Rejected. |
| `react-native-maps` **works in Expo Go with no setup** (Apple Maps iOS, Google Maps Android); API keys only needed for store deployment; **no web support** | Chosen map library. Map is native-only; web keeps the list UI (graceful degradation, same philosophy as GEO_PLAN). |

**Decisions:**
- **Map library: `react-native-maps`** — the only option that demos in Expo Go today. Web gets a fallback screen; map entry points hidden on web.
- **Push send path: plain `fetch` to `https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send`** (batches of 100) — no `expo-server-sdk` dependency; the Expo push API needs no API key and the API-route runtime stays lean.
- **Token storage: new `push_tokens` table** (not a column on `profiles`) — a user can have multiple devices, and rows can be pruned per-device on `DeviceNotRegistered` without touching the profile.
- **Coordinate exposure:** center coords serialize as-is (public places). Request coords serialize **rounded to 3 decimals (~110 m)** — they come from the creator's device, which is *usually* the hospital but could be their home; fuzzing costs nothing on a city-scale map. Donor/profile coords stay **write-only forever**.
- **Eligibility is a soft gate, not a block** — a donor in cooldown can still pledge (the actual donation happens later and centers screen anyway), but the confirm sheet warns them explicitly.

---

## Phase A — Compatibility matching: close the gaps (smallest, no schema changes)

Logic already exists in `src/lib/blood.ts` (`canDonateTo`, `donorsFor`, `recipientsFor`) — this phase is presentation only.

- [ ] **`src/components/request-card.tsx`** — distinguish **"Exact match"** (same blood type, `tone="brand"`) from **"You can help"** (compatible, `tone="success"`) in the trailing badge. Update the accessibility label accordingly.
- [ ] **`src/app/(tabs)/feed.tsx`** — in the `visible` memo's sort (currently `URGENCY_RANK` then `neededBy`): on the **All** tab, sort compatible-before-incompatible *within* the same urgency rank (critical incompatible still outranks routine compatible — urgency stays primary).
- [ ] **`src/app/request/[id].tsx`** — the screen only flips the button label today ("Respond anyway"). Add an explicit compatibility row near the blood-type glyph:
  - Compatible: tinted `Card` (`successSubtle`) — "Your `A+` is compatible with this request."
  - Incompatible: `warningSubtle` — "Your `A+` can't donate to `O-`. `O-` patients can only receive from: `O-`." (list from `donorsFor(request.bloodType)`).
  - Hidden for owners and when profile is missing.
- [ ] Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npm run lint`; expo-web preview — feed All-tab ordering, badges, detail-screen rows for compatible (amara A+ → A+ request) and incompatible (liam A- → B+ request) accounts.

---

## Phase B — Eligibility countdown: gate the respond flow (no schema changes)

`computeEligibility` + `DONATION_INTERVAL_DAYS = 56` already exist in `src/lib/blood.ts:45-61` and render on Home/Donor/donor-card. The gap: **the respond flow ignores eligibility entirely** — a donor 3 days post-donation can pledge with no warning.

- [ ] **`src/app/request/[id].tsx`** — compute `eligibility = computeEligibility(profile.lastDonationDate)` (fall back to `donations[0]?.date` like `donor.tsx:40-43` does — extract that little fallback into `src/lib/blood.ts` as `effectiveLastDonation(profile, donations)` so the three screens share it).
  - When `!eligibility.eligible`, the `ConfirmSheet` message gains a warning line: *"You're in your 56-day recovery window — eligible again {longDate(nextEligibleDate)} ({daysRemaining} days). You can still pledge; the donation would happen after that date."* Respond stays enabled (soft gate).
  - Action-bar hint below the button (caption, `textTertiary`): "Recovering · ready in N days" when in cooldown.
- [ ] **`src/app/(tabs)/feed.tsx`** — header subtitle: when in cooldown, append "· eligible again in N days" so the countdown is visible where responding happens.
- [ ] **Known gap (document, don't fix here):** no flow ever *writes* `lastDonationDate` — completing an appointment doesn't create a `donations` row or update the profile. Left for a future "mark donation complete" feature; the seed data exercises the cooldown path meanwhile (daniel@bloodbridge.demo is mid-cooldown).
- [ ] The "you're eligible again" push/local notification belongs to Phase D (needs the notification infra) — see D6.
- [ ] Verify: sign in as daniel (cooling down) → respond sheet shows the warning + dates; amara (eligible) → unchanged sheet. tsc + lint.

---

## Phase C — Map view of centers & requests

### C1 — Server: expose coordinates

- [ ] **`src/types/domain.ts`** — add `latitude?: number; longitude?: number;` to `DonationCenter` and `EmergencyRequest`.
- [ ] **`src/lib/server/serialize.ts`:**
  - `toCenter` — emit `latitude`/`longitude` when non-null (as stored; centers are public).
  - `toEmergencyRequest` — emit request coords when non-null, **rounded via `roundCoord(n, 3)`** (`src/lib/geo.ts`). `toProfile` untouched — donor coords never leave the server.
- [ ] No schema/db changes — columns exist since GEO_PLAN; seed already anchors everything in Metro Cebu.
- [ ] Verify (curl + cookie jar, PLAN.md pattern): `GET /api/centers` rows contain lat/lng; `GET /api/requests` — seeded requests have 3-decimal coords, `GET /api/profile` still has **no** coord fields.

### C2 — Client: map screen (native) + web fallback

- [ ] `npx expo install react-native-maps` — no app.json changes needed for Expo Go; store deployment later needs Google Maps API keys via the plugin (out of scope, note only).
- [ ] **New `src/components/map-view.tsx` + `src/components/map-view.native.tsx`** — Metro platform resolution keeps `react-native-maps` out of the web bundle (importing it in shared code would break the web build):
  - **`.native.tsx`**: `MapView` with `initialRegion` from `qk.location` coords (via `useLocationState()`) else the Cebu City anchor `10.3111, 123.8931` (~0.15 lat/lng delta). Markers:
    - Centers — `pinColor={theme.brand}`; callout: name, `distanceLabel(distanceKm)`, hours → `router.push('/book')`.
    - Open/partial requests with coords — pin colored by urgency via `URGENCY_TONE` → `theme.danger/warning/info`; callout: hospital, blood type, urgency → `/request/[id]`.
  - **Base (web) file**: `EmptyState` — "The map is available in the mobile app" (route stays navigable, nothing crashes).
- [ ] **New route `src/app/map.tsx`** — `ScreenHeader` "Nearby map" + the component above; register in root `_layout.tsx` as a `card` presentation (same as `request/[id]`). Data comes from the existing `useCenters()` + `useRequests()` caches — **no new endpoints, no new query keys**.
- [ ] **Entry points** (hidden on web via `Platform.OS === 'web'`):
  - `src/app/(tabs)/home.tsx` "Nearby donation center" `SectionHeader` (~line 341) → `actionLabel="Map"`.
  - `src/app/book.tsx` — small map button beside the center-list section header.
- [ ] Verify: Expo Go — map centers on device location (or Cebu anchor when denied), 4 brand pins + urgency-colored request pins, callouts navigate; web — entry points absent, `/map` shows the fallback; tsc + lint.

## Phase D — Push notifications for matching requests

### D0 — One-time setup (requires user action)

- [ ] `eas login` + `eas init` → writes `extra.eas.projectId` into `app.json` (**required** for `getExpoPushTokenAsync`).
- [ ] Note in README/PLAN: Android remote push needs a development build (`eas build --profile development --platform android`); iOS demos in Expo Go.

### D1 — Schema

- [ ] **`src/db/schema.ts`** — new table:
  ```ts
  export const pushTokens = pgTable('push_tokens', {
    id: id('ptk'),
    userId: text('user_id').notNull().references(() => user.id, { onDelete: 'cascade' }),
    token: text('token').notNull().unique(),          // ExponentPushToken[...]
    platform: text('platform').notNull(),             // 'ios' | 'android'
    updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at', tz).notNull().defaultNow(),
  });
  ```
- [ ] `npm run db:push` (additive).

### D2 — Server: token registration route

- [ ] **New `src/app/api/push-tokens+api.ts`** — `requireSession`; `POST { token, platform }` upserts by token (`onConflictDoUpdate` → reassign userId + touch updatedAt — handles device handoffs); `DELETE { token }` removes it (sign-out hygiene). Validate token shape starts with `ExponentPushToken[`. Use `handle()` + `badRequest` from `src/lib/server/http.ts`.

### D3 — Server: fan-out on new request

- [ ] **New `src/lib/server/push.ts`:**
  - `notifyMatchingDonors(request: typeof emergencyRequests.$inferSelect)` —
    1. SQL prefilter: `profiles` joined to `pushTokens`, `inArray(profiles.bloodType, donorsFor(request.bloodType))`, `ne(userId, request.ownerId)`.
    2. JS distance filter: when the request has coords **and** the donor profile has (fuzzed) coords → keep if `haversineKm ≤ 50`. Donors **without** coords are still notified (recall beats precision for a blood app; city-hash distances are meaningless for filtering).
    3. Build messages: title `🩸 {bloodType} blood needed near you`, body `{hospital}, {city} — {URGENCY_LABEL[urgency]}, {unitsNeeded} units`, `data: { url: '/request/{id}' }`, `channelId: 'default'`.
    4. `fetch('https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send', …)` in chunks of ≤100; on ticket errors `DeviceNotRegistered`, delete those token rows (minimal receipt handling — full receipt polling is out of scope).
- [ ] **`src/app/api/requests+api.ts` POST** (after the insert, ~line 85): `notifyMatchingDonors(row).catch(err => console.error('push fan-out failed', err))` — **fire-and-forget, never awaited before the 201**; a push failure must never fail a blood request. At seed scale (3 donors) inline fan-out is fine; note a queue as the future scale path.

### D4 — Client: opt-in + token registration

- [ ] `npx expo install expo-notifications`; **`app.json`** plugin: `["expo-notifications", { "defaultChannel": "default" }]` (icon/color later).
- [ ] **New `src/hooks/use-push.ts`** (mirrors `src/hooks/use-location.ts` shape):
  - `qk.push: ['push']` in `src/hooks/api/keys.ts`.
  - `usePushState()` — `getPermissionsAsync()` only, never prompts; `'unsupported'` on web/simulator (`Device.isDevice` via already-installed `expo-device`).
  - `useEnablePush()` — mutation fired **only from a user tap**: Android → `setNotificationChannelAsync('default', …)` **first**; `requestPermissionsAsync()`; on grant `getExpoPushTokenAsync({ projectId: Constants.expoConfig.extra.eas.projectId })` → `api.post('/api/push-tokens', { token, platform })`. On deny: cache `'denied'`, affordance collapses, no re-nagging.
- [ ] **New `src/components/enable-push-card.tsx`** — clone of `enable-location-card.tsx` (self-hiding pattern: render `null` unless `'undetermined'`): "**Get alerted when your blood type is needed** — we'll only notify you for requests you can actually help with." Placement: `home.tsx` next to `EnableLocationCard`, and on the Donor tab.
- [ ] **Notification foreground behavior** — `setNotificationHandler` (banner, no sound) in the same module, imported once from root `_layout.tsx`.

### D5 — Client: deep-link on tap

- [ ] **Root `src/app/_layout.tsx`** — small `useNotificationObserver()` effect (native only):
  - `addNotificationResponseReceivedListener` → `router.push(response.notification.request.content.data.url)`.
  - Cold start: `getLastNotificationResponse()` on mount → same push. Target `/request/[id]` already registered as `card`.

### D6 — "Eligible again" local notification (Phase B payoff)

- [ ] In `useEnablePush` success path (and on profile updates while granted): if `!eligibility.eligible`, `scheduleNotificationAsync` at `nextEligibleDate` 9:00 local — "You're eligible to donate again 🎉" → `data.url: '/(tabs)/donor'`. Cancel/reschedule by a fixed identifier (`'eligible-again'`) so updates never stack. Local notifications work in Expo Go on **both** platforms — this part demos everywhere.

### D — Verify

1. Server: POST `/api/push-tokens` as amara → row in Neon; duplicate POST → single row, updated timestamp.
2. Insert a fake `ExponentPushToken[test]` for liam (A- donor); POST a new A- request as amara → server log shows 1 message attempted (liam matches via `donorsFor('A-')`, amara excluded as owner); Expo API rejects the fake token → row pruned.
3. iOS Expo Go (real device): enable card → OS prompt → token registered; from a second account post a compatible request → notification arrives; tap → app opens on `/request/[id]`. Kill app, repeat → cold-start deep link works.
4. Web: enable-push card absent; everything else unchanged.
5. `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npm run lint` clean.

## Edge cases (behavior spec)

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Push fan-out throws / Expo API down | Request still returns 201; error logged only. |
| Donor has token but no coords | Notified (no distance filter applied for them). |
| Request posted without coords | All compatible donors notified (no distance filter possible). |
| `DeviceNotRegistered` ticket | Token row deleted; user re-enrolls via the card next session. |
| Web | No map entry points, `/map` shows fallback; no push card; zero behavior change otherwise. |
| Android Expo Go | Push card can render but token fetch fails → treat as `'unsupported'`, card hidden; dev build required (documented). |
| Donor in cooldown responds | Allowed; warning in ConfirmSheet + hint under button. |
| Incompatible donor responds | Still allowed ("Respond anyway", unchanged), now with an explanatory warning card. |
| Center/request row with NULL coords | Omitted from map; list UI unaffected. |
| Own request in feed | Never counted or badged as compatible (existing behavior preserved). |

## Implementation order & effort

A (½ day) → B (½ day) → C (1 day) → D (2–3 days incl. EAS setup). Each phase lands independently behind `tsc` + `lint` + the phase's verification list. Nothing in A–C requires a native rebuild; D is the only phase touching app.json plugins (Expo Go still fine on iOS).
